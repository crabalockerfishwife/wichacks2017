Instructions for interacting with UI:
- Using the ‘wasd' keys, navigate the blue man over the colored blocks to construct the if-statement
- Blocks must be collected at a specific order according to the structure of the statement
- There is a restart button on the page 
- The game ends when the blocks are successfully collected in order, or it is incorrect and prints an error statement

Any known bugs:
- When the blue man collides with any obstacles, the only way out is to rebound from the side of the obstacle

Feedback to improve project:
- Each object takes up a 25x25 panel, could be further improved by giving it a unique geometric shape that matches the image
- Give it more levels of difficulty to target different audience (import file of sets of coding blocks)
- Randomize board of obstacles and coding blocks
- Could have implemented a timer to better engage the player
