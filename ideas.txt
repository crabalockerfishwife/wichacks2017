teach children how to program

make it visual
how much knowledge do they have coming in
general concepts — specific language or no?
can’t go wrong
make it a game
escape game — pick up loops, booleans, (items) etc to write a program to escape 

stuff we r teaching
	types — integer, string, boolean
		do these match? match diff types
	boolean logic (and and or)
	if statements
	loops — different types of loops? foreach, while, for
	coding “grammar” syntax vs semantics

find an item — learn something — answer some questions to prove u know it

the whole game would be a bunch of levels but we probably only have time to code one level —- it’s going to be actually coding
